### Task Prioritization in Celery

Task prioritization allows you to control the order in which tasks are executed. By assigning different priority levels to tasks, you can ensure that more important or time-sensitive tasks are processed ahead of others.

---

1. **How Does Task Prioritization Work?** Celery’s support for task prioritization depends largely on the message broker you are using. **RabbitMQ**  is a popular broker that supports priority queues, while **Redis**  has limited native support for task priorities.**Mechanism:**  

- **Priority Attribute:**  When sending a task, you can assign a numerical priority.
  - **Lower numerical values**  represent **higher priority**  (e.g., `0` is higher priority than `9`).

- **Broker’s Role:**  The broker places tasks in a queue based on their priority. Workers then fetch tasks with the highest priority first.

- **Worker Processing:**  A worker will always pick up tasks with a higher priority (lower numerical value) before moving on to tasks with a lower priority.

---

2. **Configuring Priority in Celery** **A. In Your Task Call** When you dispatch a task, you can set the priority using the `priority` parameter with `apply_async`.

```python
from myapp.tasks import process_data

# High-priority task (0 is the highest, typically)
process_data.apply_async(args=[...], priority=0)

# Lower-priority task
process_data.apply_async(args=[...], priority=5)
```

**B. Broker Considerations** **RabbitMQ:**  

- **Priority Queues:**  RabbitMQ supports priority queues directly.

- **Queue Configuration:**  When declaring a queue in your Celery settings, you might need to specify the maximum priority level that the queue supports.

```python
from kombu import Exchange, Queue

CELERY_TASK_QUEUES = (
    Queue(
        'default',
        Exchange('default'),
        routing_key='default',
        queue_arguments={'x-max-priority': 10}  # Allow priorities 0-9
    ),
)
```

**Redis:**  

- **Limited Support:**  Redis does not natively support prioritized queues in the same way RabbitMQ does.

- **Workarounds:**  You might need to simulate prioritization by using multiple queues for different priorities and routing tasks accordingly.

3. **Practical Example in Django**
Imagine you have a task to send notifications. Some notifications are critical (e.g., password resets), while others are less urgent (e.g., weekly updates).
**Define Your Task**

```python
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task(name="myapp.tasks.send_notification")
def send_notification(user_id, message):
    # Your code to send a notification
    pass
```

**Dispatching Tasks with Priorities**

```python
# Critical notification with high priority (priority=0)
send_notification.apply_async(args=[user.id, "Reset your password immediately!"], priority=0)

# Non-critical notification with lower priority (priority=5)
send_notification.apply_async(args=[user.id, "Your weekly update is here!"], priority=5)
```

**Queue Configuration with Priority**
If you’re using RabbitMQ, configure your queue to support priorities in your Django settings (or Celery configuration file):

```python
from kombu import Exchange, Queue

CELERY_TASK_QUEUES = (
    Queue(
        'notifications',
        Exchange('notifications'),
        routing_key='notifications.send',
        queue_arguments={'x-max-priority': 10}  # Allowing priority levels 0-9
    ),
)
```

And set up routing for your task:

```python
CELERY_TASK_ROUTES = {
    'myapp.tasks.send_notification': {'queue': 'notifications', 'routing_key': 'notifications.send'},
}
```

4. **Key Points to Remember**  

- **Broker Dependency:**  Effective task prioritization relies on the capabilities of your message broker.

- **Configuration:**  For brokers like RabbitMQ, you must configure queues with a maximum priority level.

- **Numerical Values:**  Lower numerical values mean higher priority.

- **Fallback:**  For brokers like Redis, consider alternative designs (e.g., multiple queues) if prioritization is essential.

---

**Summary**
Task prioritization in Celery lets you ensure that critical tasks are handled promptly by assigning them a higher priority. With brokers like RabbitMQ, you can configure priority queues, while for others like Redis, you may need to use additional strategies.

### Implementing Task Prioritization with RabbitMQ as the Broker in Celery

Unlike Redis, **RabbitMQ**  supports native priority queues. This means you can assign a priority to tasks, and RabbitMQ will ensure that higher-priority tasks (with lower numerical values) are delivered to workers before lower-priority ones.

---

**1. Configuring a Priority Queue** To enable task prioritization with RabbitMQ, you must configure your queue with the `x-max-priority` argument. This tells RabbitMQ the maximum priority value allowed for that queue.**Example Configuration** In your Django settings or Celery configuration file (often in `celery.py`), set up the queue as follows:

```python
from kombu import Exchange, Queue

CELERY_TASK_QUEUES = (
    Queue(
        'default',
        Exchange('default'),
        routing_key='default',
        queue_arguments={'x-max-priority': 10}  # Priorities 0 (highest) to 9 (lowest)
    ),
)
```

- **`x-max-priority`** : Sets the maximum priority level. In this example, tasks can have a priority from `0` (highest priority) to `9` (lowest priority).

---

**2. Setting Up Task Routing (Optional)**
If you want to combine task routing with prioritization, you can define your routing rules. For example:

```python
CELERY_TASK_ROUTES = {
    'myapp.tasks.send_email': {'queue': 'default', 'routing_key': 'default'},
}
```

In this case, all tasks will go to the `default` queue, but they can still have different priorities.

---

**3. Dispatching Tasks with Priorities** When you send tasks, you can assign a priority using the `priority` parameter with `apply_async`. Remember, **lower numerical values represent higher priorities** .**Example Task Dispatch**

```python
from myapp.tasks import send_email

# Dispatch a high-priority task (priority=0 is the highest)
send_email.apply_async(
    args=["user@example.com", "Welcome!"],
    priority=0  # Highest priority
)

# Dispatch a lower-priority task
send_email.apply_async(
    args=["user2@example.com", "Weekly Update"],
    priority=5  # Lower priority than 0
)
```

RabbitMQ will arrange the tasks within the `default` queue based on their priority. Tasks with `priority=0` will be delivered before those with `priority=5`.

---

**4. How RabbitMQ Handles Priorities**  

1. **Queue Setup** : When the queue is declared with `x-max-priority`, RabbitMQ maintains an internal priority ordering.

2. **Task Enqueueing** : Each task is enqueued along with its priority value.

3. **Task Delivery** : RabbitMQ delivers tasks to workers in order of their priority. Tasks with lower numerical values are sent first.

---

**5. Important Considerations**  

- **Priority Limits** : Ensure the priority value you assign does not exceed the `x-max-priority` limit set on the queue. In the above example, priorities should be in the range `0-9`.

- **Broker Dependency** : This prioritization feature works because RabbitMQ supports it natively. Other brokers, like Redis, may require alternative strategies.

- **Worker Behavior** : Workers will automatically fetch tasks based on how RabbitMQ orders them in the priority queue.

---

**Summary**  

- **Queue Configuration** : Use `x-max-priority` to set up a priority queue in RabbitMQ.

- **Task Dispatching** : Use the `priority` argument in `apply_async` to specify task priority.

- **Ordering** : RabbitMQ delivers tasks based on their priority (lower numbers indicate higher priority).
