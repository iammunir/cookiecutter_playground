### Task Prioritization in Celery

Task prioritization allows you to control the order in which tasks are executed. By assigning different priority levels to tasks, you can ensure that more important or time-sensitive tasks are processed ahead of others.

---

1. **How Does Task Prioritization Work?** Celery’s support for task prioritization depends largely on the message broker you are using. **RabbitMQ**  is a popular broker that supports priority queues, while **Redis**  has limited native support for task priorities.**Mechanism:**  

- **Priority Attribute:**  When sending a task, you can assign a numerical priority.
  - **Lower numerical values**  represent **higher priority**  (e.g., `0` is higher priority than `9`).

- **Broker’s Role:**  The broker places tasks in a queue based on their priority. Workers then fetch tasks with the highest priority first.

- **Worker Processing:**  A worker will always pick up tasks with a higher priority (lower numerical value) before moving on to tasks with a lower priority.

---

2. **Configuring Priority in Celery** **A. In Your Task Call** When you dispatch a task, you can set the priority using the `priority` parameter with `apply_async`.

```python
from myapp.tasks import process_data

# High-priority task (0 is the highest, typically)
process_data.apply_async(args=[...], priority=0)

# Lower-priority task
process_data.apply_async(args=[...], priority=5)
```

**B. Broker Considerations** **RabbitMQ:**  

- **Priority Queues:**  RabbitMQ supports priority queues directly.

- **Queue Configuration:**  When declaring a queue in your Celery settings, you might need to specify the maximum priority level that the queue supports.

```python
from kombu import Exchange, Queue

CELERY_TASK_QUEUES = (
    Queue(
        'default',
        Exchange('default'),
        routing_key='default',
        queue_arguments={'x-max-priority': 10}  # Allow priorities 0-9
    ),
)
```

**Redis:**  

- **Limited Support:**  Redis does not natively support prioritized queues in the same way RabbitMQ does.

- **Workarounds:**  You might need to simulate prioritization by using multiple queues for different priorities and routing tasks accordingly.

---

3. **Practical Example in Django**
Imagine you have a task to send notifications. Some notifications are critical (e.g., password resets), while others are less urgent (e.g., weekly updates).
**Define Your Task**

```python
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task(name="myapp.tasks.send_notification")
def send_notification(user_id, message):
    # Your code to send a notification
    pass
```

**Dispatching Tasks with Priorities**

```python
# Critical notification with high priority (priority=0)
send_notification.apply_async(args=[user.id, "Reset your password immediately!"], priority=0)

# Non-critical notification with lower priority (priority=5)
send_notification.apply_async(args=[user.id, "Your weekly update is here!"], priority=5)
```

**Queue Configuration with Priority**
If you’re using RabbitMQ, configure your queue to support priorities in your Django settings (or Celery configuration file):

```python
from kombu import Exchange, Queue

CELERY_TASK_QUEUES = (
    Queue(
        'notifications',
        Exchange('notifications'),
        routing_key='notifications.send',
        queue_arguments={'x-max-priority': 10}  # Allowing priority levels 0-9
    ),
)
```

And set up routing for your task:

```python
CELERY_TASK_ROUTES = {
    'myapp.tasks.send_notification': {'queue': 'notifications', 'routing_key': 'notifications.send'},
}
```

4. **Key Points to Remember**  

- **Broker Dependency:**  Effective task prioritization relies on the capabilities of your message broker.

- **Configuration:**  For brokers like RabbitMQ, you must configure queues with a maximum priority level.

- **Numerical Values:**  Lower numerical values mean higher priority.

- **Fallback:**  For brokers like Redis, consider alternative designs (e.g., multiple queues) if prioritization is essential.

---

**Summary**
Task prioritization in Celery lets you ensure that critical tasks are handled promptly by assigning them a higher priority. With brokers like RabbitMQ, you can configure priority queues, while for others like Redis, you may need to use additional strategies.

**Implementing Task Prioritization with Redis as the Broker in Celery** Unlike **RabbitMQ** , Redis **does not support priority queues natively** . However, we can still achieve task prioritization using **multiple queues**  instead of relying on priority levels.

---

**1. Strategy: Using Multiple Queues for Different Priorities** Since Redis processes tasks in a **FIFO (First In, First Out)**  manner within a queue, we can create separate queues for **high** , **medium** , and **low**  priority tasks.**How It Works:**  

- We define multiple queues (`high_priority`, `medium_priority`, `low_priority`).

- Workers listen to these queues in a specific order, always prioritizing `high_priority` first.

- Tasks are manually routed to the appropriate queue.

- Workers listen to these queues in a specific order, always prioritizing `high_priority` first.

- Tasks are manually routed to the appropriate queue.

---

2. Configuring Multiple Queues in Celery (`settings.py`)**
Modify your Celery settings to define the priority queues.

```python
CELERY_TASK_QUEUES = (
    Queue('high_priority'),
    Queue('medium_priority'),
    Queue('low_priority'),
)
```

This creates three distinct task queues.

---

**3. Assigning Tasks to Different Priority Queues**
When sending tasks, specify the appropriate queue based on priority.

```python
from myapp.tasks import process_data

# High-priority task (time-sensitive, critical)
process_data.apply_async(args=[...], queue="high_priority")

# Medium-priority task (important but not urgent)
process_data.apply_async(args=[...], queue="medium_priority")

# Low-priority task (background processing, not time-sensitive)
process_data.apply_async(args=[...], queue="low_priority")
```

---

**4. Running Workers for Prioritized Queues**
Now, workers should be started in a way that ensures high-priority tasks are processed first.

```bash
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info -Q high_priority,medium_priority,low_priority
```

**How This Works:**  

- The worker **The worker first looks for tasks in `high_priority`** .

- If `high_priority` is empty, it moves to `medium_priority`.

- If both `high_priority` and `medium_priority` are empty, it processes `low_priority`.
✅ This way, **important tasks are always handled before less critical tasks** .

---

**5. Alternative: Running Dedicated Workers per Priority Queue**
Instead of one worker handling all queues in order, you can run dedicated workers for each queue.

```bash
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info -Q high_priority --concurrency=3
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info -Q medium_priority --concurrency=2
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info -Q low_priority --concurrency=1
```

- **High-priority worker (`concurrency=3`)** : More worker processes to handle critical tasks quickly.

- **Medium-priority worker (`concurrency=2`)** : Handles important but less urgent tasks.

- **Low-priority worker (`concurrency=1`)** : Runs infrequent background tasks.

---

**6. Example Use Case: Processing User Requests**
Imagine a system where:

- **"Send OTP"**  is a **high-priority**  task.

- **"Send Email Notification"**  is a **medium-priority**  task.

- **"Generate Reports"**  is a **low-priority**  task.

Define Tasks (`tasks.py`)**

```python
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task(name="myapp.tasks.send_otp")
def send_otp(user_id):
    # Code to send OTP
    print(f"OTP sent to user {user_id}")

@shared_task(name="myapp.tasks.send_email")
def send_email(user_id, subject, body):
    # Code to send email
    print(f"Email sent to user {user_id}: {subject}")

@shared_task(name="myapp.tasks.generate_report")
def generate_report():
    # Code to generate a report
    print("Report generated")
```

**Dispatch Tasks with Prioritization**

```python
send_otp.apply_async(args=[1], queue="high_priority")  # Urgent
send_email.apply_async(args=[1, "Welcome", "Hello!"], queue="medium_priority")  # Important
generate_report.apply_async(queue="low_priority")  # Background task
```

✅ Now, Celery ensures **OTP tasks are always executed first** , followed by emails, and then report generation.

**7. Summary** | Priority Level | Queue Name | Worker Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High | high_priority | Immediate tasks (e.g., OTP, real-time updates) |
| Medium | medium_priority | Important but not urgent (e.g., notifications) |
| Low | low_priority | Background tasks (e.g., report generation) |
**Key Takeaways:**  

- **Redis doesn’t support priority queues** , so we create separate queues for different priority levels.

- **Workers listen to queues in priority order**  or are **dedicated to specific queues** .

- **Critical tasks always execute first** , ensuring performance efficiency.
