### Error Tracking and Monitoring Celery Tasks with Sentry in Django

Sentry is a powerful tool for tracking errors and monitoring application performance, including Celery tasks. It helps you capture exceptions, debug failures, and gain insights into performance issues.

---

**1. Install Dependencies**
First, install Sentry SDK for Python, which includes Celery integration:

```sh
pip install sentry-sdk[celery]
```

---

**2. Configure Sentry in Django** Open your Django settings (`settings.py`) and configure Sentry:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.django import DjangoIntegration
from sentry_sdk.integrations.celery import CeleryIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="https://your_sentry_dsn@sentry.io/project_id",
    integrations=[DjangoIntegration(), CeleryIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,  # Adjust for performance monitoring
    send_default_pii=True,  # Capture user-related data
)
```

Replace `"https://your_sentry_dsn@sentry.io/project_id"` with your actual DSN from Sentry.

---

**3. Simulate an Error in a Celery Task**
Now, define a Celery task that raises an exception:

```python
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task
def faulty_task():
    raise ValueError("Something went wrong in Celery!")
```

Run this task:

```python
faulty_task.delay()
```

This will cause an error, and Sentry will automatically capture and log it.

---

**4. Verify Errors in Sentry**  

1. Go to your [Sentry dashboard](https://sentry.io/) .

2. Navigate to your project.

3. Check the “Issues” section to see captured Celery errors.

---

**5. Manually Log Errors in Celery**
You can also manually send errors to Sentry within your task:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task
def process_data(data):
    try:
        result = 1 / 0  # Simulated error
    except Exception as e:
        sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)
        raise e
```

Now, if an error occurs, it will be sent to Sentry before the task fails.

---

**6. Monitor Performance of Celery Tasks**
If you also want to track Celery performance (execution time, bottlenecks, etc.), enable Sentry’s performance monitoring:

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="https://your_sentry_dsn@sentry.io/project_id",
    integrations=[DjangoIntegration(), CeleryIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,  # Set a lower value (e.g., 0.1) for production
)
```

This allows you to see Celery task durations, bottlenecks, and performance traces in Sentry.

---

**7. Monitor Celery Worker Errors**
If your Celery workers crash due to an unhandled exception, Sentry can capture that too. Just ensure your Celery worker logs are properly collected.

Run the Celery worker with logs enabled:

```sh
celery -A your_project worker --loglevel=info
```

Check Sentry’s issue tracking dashboard for detailed logs and stack traces.

---

**Conclusion** With this setup:
✅ Sentry will capture any unhandled errors in Celery tasks.
✅ You can manually log errors for better debugging.
✅ Performance monitoring helps identify slow tasks.
✅ Celery worker crashes will be reported.
