**Task Grouping in Celery with Django** In Celery, **task grouping**  allows you to run multiple tasks in parallel and wait for all of them to finish before proceeding. This is useful when you have multiple independent tasks that can be executed at the same time.

**How Task Grouping Works** Celery provides a `group` primitive that helps execute multiple tasks concurrently. Instead of executing tasks one by one, the `group` function sends all tasks at once and collects their results when they are done.

**Example Use Case**
Imagine you have a Django app that processes user-uploaded images. You need to apply three different image transformations:

1. **Resize the image**

2. **Apply a watermark**

3. **Convert the image to grayscale**
Each of these tasks can be run independently, so using a **task group**  is a great approach.

**Implementation in Django with Celery** **

**1. Define Tasks in a Django App** Inside a Django app (`my_app`), create `tasks.py`:

```python
from celery import shared_task
from time import sleep

@shared_task
def resize_image(image_path):
    sleep(2)  # Simulating processing time
    return f"Resized {image_path}"

@shared_task
def apply_watermark(image_path):
    sleep(3)  # Simulating processing time
    return f"Applied watermark to {image_path}"

@shared_task
def convert_to_grayscale(image_path):
    sleep(1)  # Simulating processing time
    return f"Converted {image_path} to grayscale"
```

---

**2. Using Task Grouping** Now, let's use a `group` to run all tasks in parallel:

```python
from celery import group
from my_app.tasks import resize_image, apply_watermark, convert_to_grayscale

def process_image(image_path):
    job = group(
        resize_image.s(image_path),
        apply_watermark.s(image_path),
        convert_to_grayscale.s(image_path),
    )

    result = job.apply_async()  # Execute all tasks in parallel
    return result.get()  # Wait for all tasks to complete and return results
```

---

**3. Running the Tasks**
Now, in Django, you can run:

```python
results = process_image("user_uploads/image1.jpg")
print(results)
```

This will output something like:

```bash
['Resized user_uploads/image1.jpg',
 'Applied watermark to user_uploads/image1.jpg',
 'Converted user_uploads/image1.jpg to grayscale']
```

**Key Benefits of Task Grouping**

✅ **Parallel Execution**  – Tasks run concurrently, reducing processing time.

✅ **Better Performance**  – Instead of sequential execution, all tasks are processed at the same time.

✅ **Easier Management**  – The `group` function handles task execution and result collection automatically.
