### Task Routing in Celery with Django 
In Celery, **task routing**  is a way to control which worker should process specific tasks. This is useful when you have multiple workers and want to distribute tasks efficiently based on their type, priority, or resource requirements.

---

1. **Why Use Task Routing?**  
- **Load Balancing** : Assign different types of tasks to specialized workers.
 
- **Resource Optimization** : Run heavy tasks on powerful machines, light tasks on general workers.
 
- **Task Isolation** : Keep critical tasks separate from lower-priority ones.


---

2. **How Task Routing Works?** Celery allows you to **route tasks**  using **queues** . Each worker listens to a specific queue, and tasks are sent to the appropriate queue based on routing rules.**Key Components:**  
- **Queues** : Logical separation of tasks (e.g., `"email_tasks"`, `"database_tasks"`).
 
- **Workers** : Each worker listens to a specific queue.
 
- **Task Routing Rules** : Define which tasks go to which queue.

---

3. **Setting Up Task Routing in Django with Celery** Step 1: Define Queues in `settings.py`** 
In your Django settings, configure Celery with the required queues.


```python
CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'

CELERY_TASK_QUEUES = {
    'default': {
        'exchange': 'default',
        'routing_key': 'default',
    },
    'email_tasks': {
        'exchange': 'email',
        'routing_key': 'email.send',
    },
    'database_tasks': {
        'exchange': 'database',
        'routing_key': 'database.cleanup',
    },
}
```


---

Step 2: Configure Routing in `celery.py`** Define routing rules in the `CELERY_TASK_ROUTES` setting.

```python
CELERY_TASK_ROUTES = {
    'myapp.tasks.send_email': {'queue': 'email_tasks'},
    'myapp.tasks.cleanup_database': {'queue': 'database_tasks'},
}
```


---

Step 3: Define Celery Tasks in `tasks.py`** 
Create tasks and assign them to specific queues.


```python
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task(name="myapp.tasks.send_email")
def send_email(to, subject, message):
    # Code to send an email
    pass

@shared_task(name="myapp.tasks.cleanup_database")
def cleanup_database():
    # Code to clean up old database records
    pass
```


---

**Step 4: Start Workers with Queues** 
Now, start workers for each queue.
 
- Start a worker for the default queue:


```bash
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info
```
 
- Start a worker for the `email_tasks` queue:

```bash
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info -Q email_tasks
```
 
- Start a worker for the `database_tasks` queue:

```bash
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info -Q database_tasks
```


---

4. **Sending Tasks to Specific Queues** 
You can explicitly send tasks to a queue when calling them.


```python
send_email.apply_async(args=["user@example.com", "Welcome!", "Hello!"], queue="email_tasks")
cleanup_database.apply_async(queue="database_tasks")
```


---

5. **Automatic Routing Using Priorities (Optional)** 
You can assign priorities to tasks within a queue.


```python
send_email.apply_async(priority=5, queue="email_tasks")
cleanup_database.apply_async(priority=1, queue="database_tasks")
```

> Lower values mean higher priority.

---

**Summary** ✅ Task Routing in Celery allows directing tasks to specific workers.
✅ Tasks are assigned to **queues** .
✅ **Routing rules**  help define which tasks go to which queue.
✅ Workers listen to specific **queues**  for better efficiency.

**Exchange and Routing Key in `CELERY_TASK_QUEUES`** In Celery, task routing is built on **message broker concepts**  (e.g., Redis or RabbitMQ). Two key components in this system are: 
1. **Exchange** : A message dispatcher that determines how messages (tasks) are sent to queues.
 
2. **Routing Key** : A label that defines where a message should be delivered.


---

**1. What is an Exchange?** An **exchange**  acts as a **middleman**  that receives tasks and directs them to the correct queue(s) based on routing rules.**Types of Exchanges**  (for RabbitMQ)
Celery supports different types of exchanges, but the most common ones are:
 
- **Direct Exchange (default in Celery)** : Sends messages to a specific queue based on a matching routing key.
 
- **Topic Exchange** : Routes messages based on a pattern-matching routing key.
 
- **Fanout Exchange** : Sends messages to **all**  queues bound to the exchange (useful for broadcasting).
 
- **Headers Exchange** : Routes messages based on message headers instead of a routing key.
✅ If using **Redis as the broker** , Celery **automatically creates the necessary routing**  since Redis doesn’t have traditional exchanges like RabbitMQ.✅ If using **RabbitMQ** , understanding exchanges and routing keys is important to set up routing correctly.

---

**2. What is a Routing Key?** A **routing key**  is like an **address label**  for a task. It helps the exchange determine which queue should receive the message. 
- When a task is sent, it has a **routing key** .
 
- The **exchange**  checks the routing key and sends the task to the correct queue.
📌 **Analogy** :
Think of an exchange as a post office. 
- The **exchange**  is like the sorting center.
 
- The **routing key**  is like the ZIP code that directs letters (tasks) to the right post office (queue).

**3. How Exchange and Routing Key Work in Celery?** 
Here’s an example configuration using RabbitMQ as the broker.
Define Queues in `settings.py`** 

```python
from kombu import Exchange, Queue

CELERY_TASK_QUEUES = (
    Queue('default', Exchange('default'), routing_key='default'),
    Queue('email_tasks', Exchange('email', type='direct'), routing_key='email.send'),
    Queue('database_tasks', Exchange('database', type='direct'), routing_key='database.cleanup'),
)
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
1. `Queue('default', Exchange('default'), routing_key='default')` 
  - A default queue is created using a **direct exchange**  named `"default"`.
 
  - Any task with `routing_key="default"` goes to this queue.
 
2. `Queue('email_tasks', Exchange('email', type='direct'), routing_key='email.send')` 
  - A queue named `"email_tasks"` is created.
 
  - Uses an exchange named `"email"` (type `direct`).
 
  - Only tasks with `routing_key="email.send"` will be routed here.
 
3. `Queue('database_tasks', Exchange('database', type='direct'), routing_key='database.cleanup')` 
  - A queue named `"database_tasks"` is created.
 
  - Uses an exchange named `"database"` (type `direct`).
 
  - Only tasks with `routing_key="database.cleanup"` will be routed here.

```python
from kombu import Exchange, Queue

CELERY_TASK_QUEUES = (
    Queue('default', Exchange('default'), routing_key='default'),
    Queue('email_tasks', Exchange('email', type='direct'), routing_key='email.send'),
    Queue('database_tasks', Exchange('database', type='direct'), routing_key='database.cleanup'),
)
```
📌 **Explanation:**  
1. `Queue('default', Exchange('default'), routing_key='default')` 
  - A default queue is created using a **direct exchange**  named `"default"`.
 
  - Any task with `routing_key="default"` goes to this queue.
 
2. `Queue('email_tasks', Exchange('email', type='direct'), routing_key='email.send')` 
  - A queue named `"email_tasks"` is created.
 
  - Uses an exchange named `"email"` (type `direct`).
 
  - Only tasks with `routing_key="email.send"` will be routed here.
 
3. `Queue('database_tasks', Exchange('database', type='direct'), routing_key='database.cleanup')` 
  - A queue named `"database_tasks"` is created.
 
  - Uses an exchange named `"database"` (type `direct`).
 
  - Only tasks with `routing_key="database.cleanup"` will be routed here.


---

**4. Setting Up Task Routing Rules** Now, define **task routing rules**  to specify which tasks go to which queues.Define Routing in `celery.py`** 

```python
CELERY_TASK_ROUTES = {
    'myapp.tasks.send_email': {'queue': 'email_tasks', 'routing_key': 'email.send'},
    'myapp.tasks.cleanup_database': {'queue': 'database_tasks', 'routing_key': 'database.cleanup'},
}
```
📌 **How It Works** : 
- `myapp.tasks.send_email` will be sent to the **email_tasks**  queue using `routing_key="email.send"`.
 
- `myapp.tasks.cleanup_database` will be sent to the **database_tasks**  queue using `routing_key="database.cleanup"`.


---

**5. Starting Workers for Each Queue** 
Workers need to listen to their respective queues.


```bash
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info -Q email_tasks
```


```bash
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info -Q database_tasks
```
 
- The first worker listens to the **email_tasks**  queue.
 
- The second worker listens to the **database_tasks**  queue.


---

**6. Sending Tasks to Specific Queues** 
Now, when calling tasks, they will be routed correctly.


```python
send_email.apply_async(args=["user@example.com", "Welcome!", "Hello!"], queue="email_tasks", routing_key="email.send")
cleanup_database.apply_async(queue="database_tasks", routing_key="database.cleanup")
```
✅ The **exchange**  receives the task and checks the **routing key** .
✅ The task is then **routed to the correct queue** .

---

**7. How Task Routing Works Behind the Scenes** **Step-by-Step Flow:** 
1. A Celery task is created and sent.
 
2. The **exchange**  receives the task and checks its **routing key** .
 
3. The exchange **matches the routing key**  with the correct queue.

4. The task is placed into the appropriate queue.
 
5. A worker **listening to that queue**  picks up the task and processes it.


---

**8. What If No Routing Key Matches?**  
- If no routing key matches, the task will go to the **default queue** .

- If a task is routed incorrectly (wrong key), it may not be processed.


---

**Summary** ✅ **Exchange** : Middleman that distributes tasks to queues.
✅ **Routing Key** : Defines where tasks should go.
✅ **Queues** : Workers listen to queues and process tasks.
✅ **Routing Rules** : Define how tasks are directed to queues.This is how **Celery ensures that the right task goes to the right worker efficiently** . 🚀
